## Open 3 terminals within the project

Terminal 1:
Execute this commands:
ADDR=127.0.0.1:9001 PEERS=127.0.0.1:9001,127.0.0.1:9002 go run ./cmd/kvnode


Terminal 2:
Execute this commands:
ADDR=127.0.0.1:9002 PEERS=127.0.0.1:9001,127.0.0.1:9002 go run ./cmd/kvnode


Now you can send the first request from the terminal 3:
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9001/kv/color -d '{"value":"blue"}'


You should now see logs:
[Store] apply: <uuid> color blue
[Broadcast] firing: ...
[Broadcast] sending to peer: 127.0.0.1:9002
[Broadcast] SUCCESS sending to 127.0.0.1:9002

Read from node 2:
curl http://127.0.0.1:9002/kv/color

Should return:
{"value":"blue"}
